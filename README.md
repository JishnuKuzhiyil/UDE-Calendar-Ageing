#Battery Degradation Modeling using Universal Differential Equations

This repository contains the implementation of the battery degradation model proposed in the article "Lithium-ion Battery Degradation Modelling using universal differential equations: development of a cost-effective parameterisation methodology" by Jishnu Ayyangatu Kuzhiyil, Theo Damoulas, Ferran Planella, and Dhammika Widanalage.
Overview. 

main.jl: The main Julia script to execute the model.
RPT_analysis_data.mat: MATLAB file containing capacity and LAM (Loss of Active Material) data used in the paper.
RPTx_analysis_data.mat: Additional MATLAB file with capacity and LAM data.
